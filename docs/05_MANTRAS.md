# Mantras — Operating System for This Build

These are the three questions I ask **before writing code, adding a feature, or making a decision**.
If the answer is wrong, I stop and cut.

---

## 1. “Does this improve the first 30 seconds?”

If it does not:
- make the app feel calmer
- make the value clearer
- make the user feel understood faster

…it does not ship.

The first 30 seconds decide:
- trust
- taste
- whether Simon would share it

Everything else is secondary.

## 2. “Am I removing a decision — or adding one?”

Winning products:
- decide *for* the user
- narrow the path
- feel opinionated

Losing products:
- offer flexibility
- add options
- ask the user to configure

If this adds choice instead of clarity, it’s wrong.

## 3. “Would Simon share this without explaining it?”

Not:
- “Would judges think this is impressive?”
- “Would developers appreciate this?”
- “Is this clever?”

Only:
- “Would Simon open this, nod, and post it?”

If it needs explanation, justification, or a roadmap to make sense — it’s not ready.

## Daily Reminder

Restraint is not weakness.  
Restraint is confidence.

Calm beats clever.  
Finished beats ambitious.  
Inevitable beats impressive.
