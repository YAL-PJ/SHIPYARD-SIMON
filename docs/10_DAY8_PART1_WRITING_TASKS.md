## 1️⃣ Core Message Lock (Script Foundation)

### 1-sentence hook
When your mind is noisy, Simon gives you one calm next step.

### 15-second problem statement
Most productivity tools assume you already know what to do. In real life, people stall when attention is split, decisions feel heavy, or the day goes off track. The hardest part is not effort — it is finding a clear first move.

### 20-second product explanation
Simon is a coaching app for moments like that. You choose the coach that matches what you need right now, describe your situation in plain words, and get grounded guidance you can act on immediately. It is built to reduce overwhelm and restore forward motion.

### 30-second Focus Coach walkthrough
I open Simon, skip setup, and land on the coach choices. I tap Focus Coach and type: “I have three urgent tasks and keep switching tabs.” The coach replies with a calm reset: pick one task, define a 20-minute sprint, mute distractions, then review. I answer “Start with inbox cleanup,” and it helps me narrow the sprint so I can begin now instead of spiraling.

### 15-second monetization moment
After a few meaningful exchanges, Simon introduces premium in a calm way: unlock unlimited coaching for ongoing support. No countdowns, no pressure — just a clear upgrade for people who want steady guidance every day.

### 10-second closing
Simon helps you move from mental noise to a clear next step. If your days feel scattered, this is a calmer way to get unstuck.

## 3️⃣ Script Compression Pass

### Compressed script (under 2 minutes)
When your mind is noisy, Simon gives you one calm next step.

Most productivity tools assume you already know what to do. But when attention is split, people do not need more complexity — they need clarity.

Simon is a coaching app for that exact moment. You choose the coach you need, describe what is going on, and get grounded guidance you can act on immediately.

Here is the Focus Coach flow. I open Simon, skip setup, and tap Focus Coach. I type: “I have three urgent tasks and keep switching tabs.” The coach helps me reset with one 20-minute sprint: pick one task, mute distractions, and start before motivation drops. I answer with my chosen task, and the coach narrows the step so starting feels easy.

After a few exchanges, Simon shows premium as a calm continuation: unlimited coaching for people who want ongoing support. No pressure — just a clear choice.

Simon is built for people who are capable but overloaded. It helps you move from noise to action, one grounded step at a time.
