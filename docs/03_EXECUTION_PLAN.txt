## Day 3 — App Flow & Skeleton

### Step 1 — Routing & Monetization Logic (LOCKED)

Goal: Define app behavior before code.

Locked Behavior:

- Free tier has limited messages per day
- No visible counters or warnings
- Paywall appears only when limit is exceeded and assistant is about to reply
- If paywall is dismissed, conversation pauses until next day

One-line flow:
First launch: Open → Welcome / Context → Home → coach chat → clarity → limit → calm paywall → choice
Returning launch: Open → Focus Coach → clarity → limit → calm paywall → choice

Step locked. Skeleton can be built safely.
