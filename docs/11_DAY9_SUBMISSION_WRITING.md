# Day 9 — Submission Writing Pack

This file completes all Day 9 writing deliverables for submission.

## 1️⃣ Problem Statement

### Short version (Devpost-friendly)
People do not usually get stuck because they lack ambition — they get stuck because their thinking is noisy in the moment. Existing productivity tools assume users already know what to do next, but many moments of friction are actually clarity problems: too many priorities, unclear tradeoffs, or unresolved mental loops. Simon is built to solve that exact moment by giving calm, opinionated guidance that helps users move forward immediately.

### Expanded version
Most productivity software is optimized for planning, tracking, and organizing. Those tools are useful once a person is already clear. But when someone feels overwhelmed or mentally tangled, more structure can add more pressure.

Simon focuses on a narrower, more common problem: the gap between feeling stuck and taking the next meaningful step. The product is designed for users who are capable and motivated, but temporarily blocked by cognitive overload. Instead of dashboards, templates, or complex systems, Simon delivers grounded coaching in plain language so the user can regain momentum fast.

## 2️⃣ Why 3 Coaches

Simon intentionally ships with exactly three coaches:
- Focus Coach
- Decision Coach
- Reflection Coach

This constraint is a product decision, not a limitation.

### Rationale
1. **Clarity over abundance**  
   Too many modes create friction at the exact moment users need speed.
2. **Distinct stuck states**  
   The three coaches map to three real situations: scattered priorities, difficult choices, and mental/emotional fog.
3. **Behavior separation**  
   Each coach has a clear posture and role boundary, which makes responses feel purposeful instead of generic.
4. **Opinionated product feel**  
   A curated set signals confidence and reduces setup decisions for first-time users.

## 3️⃣ Behavior-First Design Rationale

Simon is behavior-first rather than feature-first.

### What that means
- The system is designed around the *moment of stuckness*, not around maximizing UI complexity.
- Coach behavior (tone, brevity, decisiveness, role integrity) is treated as core product surface.
- The interaction is optimized for “what helps this user feel clearer in the next minute?”

### Why this matters
Traditional AI chat products often drift toward broad assistance. Simon does the opposite: it narrows the interaction on purpose.

- Focus Coach narrows to one priority.
- Decision Coach narrows tradeoffs toward commitment.
- Reflection Coach slows pace to surface signal.

By locking behavior and role boundaries, the product avoids generic advice and preserves a consistent, calm coaching experience.

## 4️⃣ Monetization Logic

Simon uses a calm, value-first monetization model.

### Free tier
- Access to all three coaches
- Limited messages per day
- Enough usage to understand product value

### Paid tier
- Unlimited coaching messages
- Persistent context and continuity
- Premium customization path (coach duplication/editing)

### Why this model
1. **Value before paywall**  
   Users experience useful coaching before being asked to upgrade.
2. **Low-friction adoption**  
   No account wall is required to test core value.
3. **Natural premium boundary**  
   Message volume and continuity are clear upgrade triggers for repeat users.
4. **Tone alignment**  
   Monetization stays respectful and non-manipulative, consistent with the product’s calm voice.

## 5️⃣ Roadmap (Post-MVP)

### Near-term roadmap
1. **Auto-routing to the right coach**  
   Detect intent from user language and route to Focus, Decision, or Reflection automatically.
2. **Deeper context continuity**  
   Stronger memory across sessions for premium users, while keeping responses concise.
3. **Coach personalization (premium)**  
   Expand duplicate/edit flows so users can tune style while preserving role integrity.
4. **Sharing (later)**  
   Add safe sharing patterns for useful coaching moments once the core loop is stable.

### Roadmap principle
Growth features come after reliability and behavioral quality. The priority is preserving a calm, high-trust coaching experience while expanding convenience.

## 6️⃣ Paste-Ready Devpost Draft (Single Block)

Simon is a mobile coaching app for a common productivity problem: people often know they *want* to move forward, but in the moment they feel mentally noisy and stuck.

Instead of adding more planning tools, Simon provides calm, opinionated guidance to restore clarity quickly. The product is intentionally scoped around three coaches, each with a distinct role:
- Focus Coach for prioritizing what matters now
- Decision Coach for resolving tradeoffs
- Reflection Coach for stepping back and seeing clearly

This three-coach model keeps the experience simple and reduces choice overload, while still covering the most common “stuck states.”

Simon is behavior-first by design. The core product is not a long feature list; it is the quality of coaching behavior — concise responses, role integrity, and guidance that reduces complexity rather than adding it.

Monetization follows a value-first model. Free users can access all coaches with limited daily messages, and premium unlocks unlimited coaching, stronger continuity, and future personalization features. The paywall is designed to feel calm and respectful, not urgent or manipulative.

Post-MVP, the roadmap focuses on auto-routing users to the right coach, improving memory/continuity, adding premium coach personalization, and introducing sharing later once the core experience is fully stable.
