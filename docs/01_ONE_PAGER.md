## App One-Liner
**Calm, opinionated AI coaching for the moment you feel stuck.**

---

## Objective
Build a **working, monetizable mobile MVP** that Simon (Better Creating) would confidently share with his audience **without explanation**.

This is not a demo.
This is not an AI experiment.
This is a calm, opinionated product that feels finished.

---

## Audience
- Productivity-focused creators, builders, solopreneurs
- Tech-savvy, anti-friction
- Fans of Notion systems, AgentOS-style thinking, intentional tools

**Core insight:**  
They want fewer, smarter decisions made for them.

---

## The Moment We Solve
“I’m stuck right now — overwhelmed, unfocused, or unsure — and I need calm, intelligent guidance immediately.”

We solve a moment, not a lifestyle.

---

## Product Vision
A **minimalist AI coaching app in your pocket** that delivers calm, opinionated guidance exactly when the user feels stuck.

Design values:
- Minimal
- Tasteful
- Opinionated
- Immediate
- Finished

Think:
- iPhone Health (curated insight)
- Notion templates (opinionated defaults)
- AgentOS (multi-mode, zero setup)

---

## MVP Scope (Locked)
Exactly **three coaches**:

1. **Focus / Priority Coach** (hero, default)
2. **Decision Coach**
3. **Reflection Coach**

Why three:
- Maximum clarity
- Zero redundancy
- Signals confidence and taste
- Matches Simon’s philosophy

## The Three Coaches (Locked)

### Focus Coach
**Decide what actually matters right now.**

### Decision Coach
**Get unstuck between competing options.**

### Reflection Coach
**Step back and see clearly.**

---

## Core Flow
1. Open app
2. See three coach cards
3. (Optional) add personal context / values
4. Tap coach → instant chat
5. Receive guidance
6. Hit paywall after value

All copy is locked before design begins.  
Design exists to reinforce meaning, not discover it.

Home Screen Title: **“What do you need right now?”**

---

## Browse / Create / Share (MVP Interpretation)
- Browse = choose between the 3 curated coaches
- Create = duplicate + personalize (premium)
- Share = roadmap only (post-MVP)

---

## Monetization (RevenueCat)
Free:
- Limited chats per day
- All three coaches
- Temporary context memory

Paid subscription:
- Unlimited chats
- Persistent context
- Coach duplication/editing
- Future coaches

Paywall tone: calm, respectful, obvious.
Paywall Headline: **Unlimited calm, when you need it.**
